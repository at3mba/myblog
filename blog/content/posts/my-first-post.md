# My Journey into Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing

## Introduction

Over the past few years, I’ve been on an exciting journey into two incredibly dynamic fields: **Cybersecurity** and **Cloud Computing**. These fields are not only vital to modern technology but also offer countless opportunities for growth and learning. In this blog post, I’ll share my experiences, from my first steps into cybersecurity with ethical hacking to diving into the cloud computing world and earning certifications along the way.

## My Cybersecurity Journey

### Discovering Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has always intrigued me because it combines problem-solving with the thrill of defending systems and data from malicious actors. My journey began with a desire to understand how attackers work and how to safeguard against them.

### Taking the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) Course

One of my major milestones in cybersecurity was enrolling in the **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** course through NetAcad. This course laid the foundation for my understanding of ethical hacking, penetration testing, and system vulnerabilities. Some of the skills I developed include:

- **Reconnaissance and Footprinting**: Learning how attackers gather information about their targets.
- **Scanning Networks**: Discovering how attackers find vulnerabilities by scanning for open ports and services.
- **Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities**: Identifying common weaknesses like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

The hands-on labs were crucial for gaining practical knowledge and boosted my interest in **offensive security**, where the goal is not just to identify vulnerabilities but to exploit them in a controlled, legal manner.

### Moving to Offensive Security

After completing my CEH certification, I decided to dive deeper into **offensive security**. This path involves not only finding vulnerabilities but also actively exploiting them, often as part of penetration testing or red teaming. Some of my experiences include:

- **Penetration Testing**: Conducting real-world tests to uncover and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Red Team Exercises**: Simulating attacks to identify security weaknesses in a controlled environment.
- **Bug Bounty Programs**: Participating in platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd to hone my skills in real-world scenarios.

## My Cloud Computing Journey

### Introduction to Cloud Computing

At the same time, I started exploring **Cloud Computing**, which has revolutionized the way businesses operate and deploy applications. The cloud offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, which are essential for modern IT solutions.

### Earning AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification

To build my foundational knowledge in cloud computing,I enrolled into the **AWS.restart** programm and took the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** certification. This helped me understand the core services and offerings of **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, such as EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM, and how to navigate AWS for different cloud solutions.

- **Cloud Architecture**: Learning how to design scalable, fault-tolerant cloud infrastructures.
- **AWS Services**: Gaining hands-on experience with AWS products, from compute resources to storage and security.
- **Security in the Cloud**: Understanding the shared responsibility model and best practices for securing cloud environments.

### Advanced Cloud Learning

Building on this foundation, I’ve continued to deepen my understanding of **cloud security** and **cloud-native technologies**. I’ve learned how cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud integrate security measures and enable enterprises to manage complex cloud environments.

## Bridging the Gap Between Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing

One of the most exciting aspects of working in these fields is how they intersect. As more companies migrate to the cloud, securing cloud environments has become a major priority. Understanding both **cybersecurity** and **cloud computing** gives me the unique advantage of ensuring cloud systems are not only efficient but also secure.

Here are some key areas where these two fields overlap:

- **Cloud Security**: Implementing security best practices to protect cloud-based infrastructure.
- **DevSecOps**: Integrating security into the development and operations lifecycle.
- **Penetration Testing in the Cloud**: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud-hosted systems.

## The Road Ahead

As I continue to grow in these fields, I am excited about the endless opportunities to learn and improve. Whether it's continuing to explore new cloud technologies, gaining deeper penetration testing skills, or staying ahead of emerging cybersecurity threats, there’s always something new on the horizon. 

I’m eager to continue expanding my skills and contributing to the security and reliability of cloud environments.

## Conclusion

My journey in both cybersecurity and cloud computing has been both challenging and rewarding. Each field offers its own set of unique challenges, but they complement each other in today’s technology-driven world. For anyone interested in diving into these fields, I encourage you to take the first step – whether it's through learning, hands-on practice, or pursuing certifications. The journey is worth it!
